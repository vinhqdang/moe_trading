# Mixture of Experts (MoE) Simulation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes a series of simulations conducted with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) trading system. The goal of these simulations was to analyze how the system performs under different market scenarios and with an expanded set of expert agents.

## Simulation Setup

*   **Experts:** The core set of four experts (Trend, Mean Reversion, Volatility, Sentiment) was expanded to include two new experts:
    *   **`GeopoliticalExpert`**: Reacts to geopolitical events.
    *   **`MacroeconomicExpert`**: Reacts to macroeconomic conditions.
*   **Meeting Rounds:** The number of meeting rounds was increased to 10 to allow for more in-depth discussions.
*   **Scenarios:** Three distinct scenarios were simulated:
    1.  **`ukraine_victory_russia`**: A bearish geopolitical scenario where Russia makes significant gains in Ukraine.
    2.  **`ukraine_victory_ukraine`**: A bullish geopolitical scenario where Ukraine makes significant gains.
    3.  **`recession`**: A bearish macroeconomic scenario where the global economy is entering a recession.

## Key Findings

### Scenario 1: `ukraine_victory_russia` (Bearish Geopolitical)

*   **Key Driver:** The `GeopoliticalExpert` provided a strong "sell" signal, which created a powerful bearish narrative.
*   **Discussion:** The bearish sentiment from the `GeopoliticalExpert` was amplified by the `TrendExpert` and `VolatilityExpert`, leading to a quick consensus.
*   **Outcome:** A strong "sell" consensus was reached with high confidence (0.75).

### Scenario 2: `ukraine_victory_ukraine` (Bullish Geopolitical)

*   **Key Driver:** The `GeopoliticalExpert` provided a strong "buy" signal, which conflicted with the "sell" signals from the technical experts.
*   **Discussion:** The conflicting signals led to a more nuanced and lengthy discussion. The `VolatilityExpert`, initially a strong "sell", was persuaded to change their recommendation to "hold".
*   **Outcome:** A more balanced "hold" consensus was reached with a lower confidence (0.56).

### Scenario 3: `recession` (Bearish Macroeconomic)

*   **Key Driver:** The `MacroeconomicExpert` provided a strong "sell" signal, creating a powerful bearish narrative.
*   **Discussion:** Similar to the first scenario, the bearish sentiment from the `MacroeconomicExpert` was amplified by the other experts, leading to a quick consensus. Even the typically contrarian `MeanReversionExpert` was persuaded to change their recommendation to "sell".
*   **Outcome:** A strong "sell" consensus was reached with high confidence (0.76).

## Overall Analysis

These simulations demonstrate the power of a single, strong narrative to shape the expert discussion and the final consensus. The addition of the `GeopoliticalExpert` and `MacroeconomicExpert` made the simulations much more realistic and highlighted the importance of considering a wide range of factors when making trading decisions. The MoE system proved to be a valuable tool for exploring complex market scenarios and for understanding the dynamics of expert collaboration.
